# 1. Simulate Data

```{r simulate-data}
# During knitting, working directory is `notebooks/`, so go up one level to `scripts/`
source("../scripts/01_simulate_data.R")
glimpse(df)
```

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r eda-density}
# Source the EDA script from the project root
source("../scripts/02_eda_balance.R")
```

# 3. Propensity Score Matching

```{r psm}
# Source the matching script
source("../scripts/03_matchit_psm.R")
```

# 4. Inverse Probability Weighting

```{r ipw}
# Source the IPW script
source("../scripts/04_ipw.R")
```

# 5. Doubly‐Robust TMLE

```{r drtmle}
# Source the DRTMLE script (or function‐based wrapper)
source("../scripts/05_drtmle_dr.R")
```

# 6. Summary & Conclusions

In this analysis, we have:

- Simulated an A/B testing scenario with confounded covariates.  
- Performed exploratory plots and calculated pre‐matching balance.  
- Used Propensity Score Matching to create a balanced subsample and visualized the post‐matching love plot.  
- Applied Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to estimate the ATE with weighted regression.  
- Implemented a Doubly‐Robust TMLE estimator to obtain a final ATE and 95% CI.

**Key takeaways:**

- The naïve difference‐in‐means is biased due to covariate imbalance.  
- Both PSM and IPW improved covariate balance, as seen in Love plots and SMD tables.  
- The Doubly‐Robust TMLE estimate incorporates both outcome regression and propensity scoring, providing consistent ATE under misspecification of one nuisance model.  
- In our simulated setup (true ATE = 1.5), the TMLE estimate should be close to 1.5 with a narrow confidence interval, demonstrating good performance.

**Potential extensions:**

- Introduce interactions or non‐linear terms into the propensity/outcome models.  
- Compare Bayesian causal models (e.g., via `rstanarm`) with frequentist TMLE.  
- Build a Shiny dashboard to let users adjust simulation parameters (sample size, confounding strength) and instantly visualize how each method behaves.
